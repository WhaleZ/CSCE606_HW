Feature: search for movies by director
  As a movie buff
  So that I can find movies with my favorite director
  I want to include and serach on director information in movies I enter

  Background: movies in database      # features/search_by_director.feature:7
    Given the following movies exist: # features/step_definitions/movies_steps.rb:2
      | title        | rating | director     | release_date |
      | Star Wars    | PG     | George Lucas | 1977-05-25   |
      | Blade Runner | PG     | Ridley Scott | 1982-06-25   |
      | Alien        | R      |              | 1979-05-25   |
      | THX-1138     | R      | George Lucas | 1971-03-11   |

  Scenario: add director to existing movie                # features/search_by_director.feature:16
    When I go to the edit page for "Alien"                # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:48
    And I fill in "Director" with "Ridley Scott"          # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:60
    And I press "Update Movie Info"                       # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:52
    Then the director of "Alien" should be "Ridley Scott" # features/step_definitions/movies_steps.rb:27

  Scenario: find movie with same director                       # features/search_by_director.feature:22
    Given I am on the details page for "Star Wars"              # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:44
    When I follow "Find Movies With Same Director"              # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:56
    Then I should be on the Similar Movies page for "Star Wars" # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:230
    And I should see "THX-1138"                                 # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:105
    But I should not see "Blade Runner"                         # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:123

  Scenario: can't find similar movies if we don't know director (sad path) # features/search_by_director.feature:29
    Given I am on the details page for "Alien"                             # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:44
    Then I should not see "Ridley Scott"                                   # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:123
    When I follow "Find Movies With Same Director"                         # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:56
    Then I should be on the home page                                      # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:230
    And I should see "'Alien' has no director info"                        # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:105

Deprecation Warnings:

Requiring `rspec/autorun` when running RSpec via the `rspec` command is deprecated. Called from /Users/whalez/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.4.0/gems/activesupport-4.2.10/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:274:in `require'.

Using `should` from rspec-expectations' old `:should` syntax without explicitly enabling the syntax is deprecated. Use the new `:expect` syntax or explicitly enable `:should` with `config.expect_with(:rspec) { |c| c.syntax = :should }` instead. Called from /Users/whalez/Documents/hw-acceptance-unit-test-cycle/rottenpotatoes/spec/movies_controller_spec.rb:26:in `block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'.

Using `stub` from rspec-mocks' old `:should` syntax without explicitly enabling the syntax is deprecated. Use the new `:expect` syntax or explicitly enable `:should` instead. Called from /Users/whalez/Documents/hw-acceptance-unit-test-cycle/rottenpotatoes/spec/movies_controller_spec.rb:24:in `block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'.


If you need more of the backtrace for any of these deprecations to
identify where to make the necessary changes, you can configure
`config.raise_errors_for_deprecations!`, and it will turn the
deprecation warnings into errors, giving you the full backtrace.
